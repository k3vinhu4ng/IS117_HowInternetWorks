                <h1>Invention</h1>
                <p> The invention of the internet completely altered the trajectory of the human race, “it is on par
                    with
                    the
                    wheel, fire, language, the printing press.” From a computer as big as a room to millions and
                    millions of
                    websites and computers connected around the world. In short, the internet was born from a domino
                    effect
                    created by the space race between the Soviets and the United States. Dwight D. Eisenhower created
                    ARPA
                    in 1958, the Advanced Research Projects Agency to keep up with the Soviets. NASA later stepped up to
                    the
                    plate, but the creation of ARPA helped deploy the first bare-bones internet in 1969. At first, it
                    was to
                    reduce redundancy, instead of opening up three terminals to work on three computers, it was better
                    to
                    open up just one terminal to talk to all three computers. Many graduates students, and researchers,
                    and
                    of course, ARPA wanted to create a network that would allow communication between computers in
                    different
                    places. The big challenge was how information should be sent over the network of computers. Paul
                    Baran
                    came up with the idea of breaking up the information into small packets that would be sent across
                    different nodes of computers. Each packet contained information like where it came from, what it
                    contained, and where it was going. At first, computers were only able to communicate between other
                    computers on the sam</p>
                <p>The first-ever form of the internet was a network established between a couple of universities across
                    the
                    United States, called the ARPA network. Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT grad student applied the queuing
                    theory on data transmission, and it is what the ARPA network used. Queuing theory is simply a system
                    in
                    which something arrives somewhere, then goes on to the next destination, similar to an envelope in
                    the
                    mail, which goes through different post offices until it reaches its destination. This data
                    transmission
                    was implemented using the demand access technique and distributed control. This meant that data was
                    only
                    sent through nodes depending on how urgent it was, and no node had supreme control over the entire
                    network.
