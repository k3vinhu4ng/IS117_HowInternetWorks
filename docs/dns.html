                <h1>Searching</h1>
                <p>
                    When the word wide web was just an infant, there was no way of typing something into a search bar
                    and getting relevant information. You would have to traverse the web by continuously clicking links
                    until you arrived at what you were looking for, making the world wide web utterly useless. But along
                    came some great minds from Stanford University that completely changed the internet forever.

                <p>
                    To start, two Stanford University students, David Filo and Jerry Yang were one day scouring the
                    internet looking for relevant information on sports for their fantasy basketball team. They came
                    across the idea that the internet should be easily searchable. They launched their website Yahoo
                    that simply broke the internet into categories, and they spent hours looking at websites choosing in
                    which category they belonged to. This caught the attention of some venture capitalists, because
                    Yahoo was getting lots of traffic to their site. Venture CApitalists obviously want to make money,
                    so they urged Yahoo to put advertisements on their page. The founders were skeptical at first, so
                    they tested it out with small banner ads. Their users did not complain so they put out even more
                    advertisements. Yahoo was also competing with another website called Excite. The competition was
                    fierce. If one company released a feature, so did the other. Those companies soon lost sight of why
                    they were created in the first place, as a search engine. Their searching capabilities were poor
                    because they just showed websites that matched specific words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then along came Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students also from Stanford University. they came up
                    with a clever way to search the internet. They figured that if a specific webpage with specific
                    keywords was linked to other websites, it meant that the page in question was relevant. The more
                    websites pointed to another, the more relevant it became. This made results while searching the
                    internet far more relevant. They soon began looking for an investment to keep their startup going.
                    They asked many venture capitalists, and many turned them down. They didn't want to invest in
                    another search engine that did the same thing, they missed out on an investment of a lifetime. While
                    Larry Page and Sergey Brin were looking for investments, they had a meeting with a rival search
                    engine, Excite. Google offered Excite the entire company for a measly 1 million dollars! Google as
                    of February 2021 is worth almost 1.4 trillion dollars.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Google, after securing small investments from many investors, they began to grow rapidly. Not only
                    did Google offer relevant search results, they also offered relevant advertisements. This completely
                    changed the internet forever, while also making it highly profitable. Google takes part in my
                    everyday life from its calendar, to its email service, and most importantly its search engine.
